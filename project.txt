🎓 Project Title: Smart Student Team Clustering System
💡 Project Overview:
This project aims to simplify and automate the process of grouping students into balanced teams (Topper, Average, Duller) based on their academic performance. Balanced teams can be used for project work, seminars, or group tasks. The system ensures diversity in learning ability within each team, promoting peer learning and collaboration.

🧰 Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js

Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: JWT or Session-based

Hosting (Optional): Render / Vercel for frontend, Railway / Heroku for backend

🔐 User Roles:
1. HOD (Head of Department)
One HOD per branch: CSE, IT, ECE, EEE, MECH

Each HOD manages:

4 Years (1st to 4th)

Each Year has 4 Sections (A, B, C, D)

Each Year contains 2 Semesters

2. Student
Can log in and view:

Their semester marks

Team batch they are assigned to (Topper/Average/Duller)

✨ Key Features:
🔑 Login System:
Separate login for HOD and Students

Secure authentication (JWT recommended)

🧑‍🏫 HOD Dashboard:
Add new student data (Name, Roll No, Branch, Year, Section, Semester-wise marks)

View students year-wise and section-wise

Automatically cluster students into balanced teams based on marks

View and edit team clusters manually

Remove or update student info if needed

Filter students by:

Year

Section

Semester

Performance type (Topper/Average/Duller)

👨‍🎓 Student Dashboard:
View personal profile

View semester-wise marks

View the team (batch) they are grouped into

⚙️ How the Team Clustering Works (Non-ML):
Define simple thresholds for each category:

Topper: 80% and above

Average: 60% to 79%

Duller: Below 60%

Sort students based on average marks

Group students into teams:

Each team = 1 Topper + 1 Average + 1 Duller (or similar depending on size)

📈 Extra Suggestions to Impress Lecturers:
✅ Add Features
Export clusters to Excel or PDF

Show pie/bar charts (performance distribution) using Chart.js in React

Option to backup/download all student data

Notification when students are reassigned to new teams

✅ UI Ideas
Clean Material UI or Bootstrap styling

Add a step-by-step wizard when entering student data

Dashboard cards showing:

Total Students

No. of Teams

Top 5 performers

Count of each category (Topper, Average, Duller)

📋 Future Scope
Apply Machine Learning later to automate and optimize clustering

Add attendance and behavior data to improve clustering

Integrate with college LMS or Google Classroom

🧪 Testing Ideas
Add dummy data for all 5 branches

Show sample team generation

Test manual editing of clusters

Test both HOD and Student logins with mock credentials
